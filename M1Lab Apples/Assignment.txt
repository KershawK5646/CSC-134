For this assignment we pretend we've been hired by an apple salesperson to 
write a program to advertise their products. (In this case, it's the fruit, 
not the company.)

The salesperson's name is Jane Smith, and she has 100 apples for sale. Each 
apple costs 25 cents.

Our goal is to use repl.it to write a program which displays the salesperson's 
store name, the number of apples, price per apple, and the price to purchase 
all of them at once.

Submit your source code along with a screenshot of the running program using 
the format discussed in the previous assignment.
